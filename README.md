### Hello, everyone! I'm Alonso Jacobo.

ðŸ”­ I used to be a science student specialized in computational chemistry and computer science. Now, I'm embarking on my journey as a developer. Currently, I work as a professor, and in my free time, I strive to learn about the latest technologies and enhance my programming skills to align with these advancements.

ðŸŒ± I am actively seeking opportunities to work for a company where I can continue to learn and immerse myself in the real-world applications of programming. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to projects that challenge me and allow me to grow as a developer. I value the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment where I can learn from experienced professionals and contribute to meaningful projects

I am currently learning about React and GraphQL, and I am also participating in a web development boot camp. My skills are focused on front-end development, but I am actively studying to become a full-stack developer.
